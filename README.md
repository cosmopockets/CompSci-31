# CompSci-31
This repository is for my Computer Science 31 course at Las Positas College. The CS31 is taught in Java and will cover Applets, GUI programming and design using Swing, presenting data files over the web
elementary data structures (queues, linked list, stacks) and vectors. It will also cover searching (linear, binary)
sorting algorithms, Database programming using JDBC (java Data Base Connectivity), Remote method Invocation(RMI) and Java Beans.
I am taking this course to improve my knowledge and skills in the java programming language in order to improve my passion for Android Development. I also plan to find a fellow student with whom I can work on projects with in and outside of class. 
This repository will be updated regularly throughtout the semester with homeowork assignments as well as any group projects.
